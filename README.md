# Spectral Denoising and Denoising search

## Description
This repository contains all necessary code for Spectral Denoising and Denoising Search, as well as codes for generating figures in mansucript: "Denoising Search doubles the numbelof metabolite and exposome annotations inhuman plasma using an Orbitrap Astral massspectrometer".

## Goal
1. remove noise ions in MS/MS spectra based on elemental-formula information;
  
2. Improve high confidence compound annotations based on denoised spectra

## Data
All related experiemental data can be found on google drive: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xSKtLqNXukj6V8qP9c_e5MAbmbDLg2Ml?usp=sharing)

## Usage
The algorithm was developed in a conda environment with Python 3.8. A yaml file will be provided shortly for compiling necessary dependencies.

Basical usage:
