# Spectral Denoising and Denoising search

## This repository contains all necessary code for Spectral Denoising and Denoising Search, as well as codes to generating figures in mansucript: "Denoising Search doubles the numbelof metabolite and exposome annotations inhuman plasma using an Orbitrap Astral massspectrometer".

## Goal: a set of algorithms that will 1. remove noise ions in MS/MS spectra based on elemental-formula information; 2. Improve high confidence compound annotations based on denoised spectra

## Data
all correlated experiemental data can be found at either the supplementary materials or on google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xSKtLqNXukj6V8qP9c_e5MAbmbDLg2Ml?usp=sharing)
